# Whop Webhook Setup Complete! âœ…

## What Was Done

1. **Created New Webhook in Whop Dashboard**
   - URL: `https://allumi.com/api/webhooks/whop`
   - API Version: V5
   - Events Selected:
     - membership_went_valid
     - membership_went_invalid
     - payment_succeeded
     - payment_failed

2. **Webhook Secret Copied**
   - The secret has been copied to your clipboard
   - It starts with: `ws_2da9f...`
   - Full secret is in your clipboard now

## Next Steps

### 1. Update .env.local
Paste the webhook secret from your clipboard:
```env
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<paste_from_clipboard>
```

### 2. Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Webhook
```bash
node test-whop-webhook.js
```

## Webhook Details

- **Production URL**: https://allumi.com/api/webhooks/whop
- **Local Testing**: http://localhost:3002/api/webhooks/whop
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**: X-Whop-Signature (for verification)

## Events We're Listening For

1. **membership_went_valid** - When a subscription becomes active
2. **membership_went_invalid** - When a subscription is cancelled/expired
3. **payment_succeeded** - When a payment goes through
4. **payment_failed** - When a payment fails

## Important Notes

- The webhook endpoint is already implemented in `/app/api/webhooks/whop/route.ts`
- The endpoint verifies signatures using the secret
- All events are logged to the `whop_events` table in Supabase
- User subscription status is automatically updated based on events

## Testing

Once you've pasted the secret, you can test with:

1. **Local test** (with mock signature):
   ```bash
   node test-whop-webhook.js
   ```

2. **Production test** - Make a test purchase or use Whop's webhook testing tool

## Troubleshooting

If webhooks aren't working:
1. Check the secret is correctly pasted (no extra spaces)
2. Verify the URL is accessible from internet
3. Check Supabase logs for any database errors
4. Look at server logs for signature verification issues
