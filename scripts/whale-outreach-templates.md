Hey [Name]! 👋

Been following your [Community Name] growth - hitting $[MRR]k MRR is incredible!

Building something that answers this exact question. Would love your thoughts on what metrics matter most to you.
```

### Template 2: Problem-Aware Opener
```
Hey [Name], saw your post about [specific problem/question about growth].

We actually solved this for [Similar Community] - they discovered 73% of their paid members came from just 2 YouTube videos, not their ads.

Mind if I share how they figured this out?
```

### Template 3: Authority Builder
```
[Name], your [specific strategy] approach is smart.

## 📧 EMAIL OUTREACH SEQUENCES

### Subject Lines That Work:
- "Quick question about [Community Name]'s growth"
- "[Name], found something interesting about your YouTube strategy"
- "Data on what's driving Skool payments (from analyzing 50+ communities)"
- "Your $[MRR]k MRR growth - spotted an opportunity"

### Email Sequence - Day 1
**Subject: Quick question about [Community Name]'s growth**
```
Hey [Name],

Impressive work growing [Community Name] to $[MRR]k MRR!

I've been analyzing how top Skool communities track their attribution, and noticed most are flying blind on what content actually drives paying members vs free users.

For example, [Similar Community] discovered their highest-converting content wasn't their ads - it was a single YouTube video that drove 73% of paid signups.

Are you currently tracking which specific content/ads convert to paid members?

If interested, happy to share what we're seeing across the top 100 Skool communities.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Email Sequence - Day 3 (Follow-up)
**Subject: Re: Quick question about [Community Name]'s growth**
```
Hey [Name],

Know you're busy scaling [Community Name]. 

Quick update - just analyzed the top 100 Skool communities' traffic sources. The average community is wasting 67% of ad spend on channels that only drive free members.

Created a brief report on this if you're interested. Takes 2 min to read.

Worth a quick chat?

[Your name]
```

### Email Sequence - Day 7 (Final)
**Subject: Should I close your file?**
```
[Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm guessing either:
1. You already have attribution tracking solved
2. Not a priority right now
3. My emails are hitting spam

If it's #1, I'd love to learn your approach.
If it's #2, I'll check back in a few months.
If it's #3, might see this on LinkedIn 😄

Either way, keep crushing it with [Community Name]!

[Your name]

P.S. If you ever want to know which content drives paying members, just reply.

## 🎁 BONUS: OBJECTION HANDLERS

**"We already use Google Analytics"**
> GA shows traffic, not individual member journeys. You can see 1000 visits but not which specific content converted John who pays $99/mo vs Mike who joined free.

**"Too expensive for us right now"**
> Totally understand. Most communities discover they're wasting 60%+ of marketing budget on wrong channels. The ROI is usually week 1. What if we started with a free attribution audit?

**"We're not focused on attribution"**
> Fair! Quick question though - if you knew exactly which 3 pieces of content drove 80% of your revenue, what would you do with that info?

**"How is this different from [competitor]?"**
> [Competitor] tracks clicks. We track the full journey from first touch to payment, specifically for subscription communities. Plus we integrate with Skool's actual payment data, not just signups.

**Remember: The goal isn't to sell on first touch. It's to start a conversation about a problem they already have.**
