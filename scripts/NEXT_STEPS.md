# 🎯 Allumi - Next Steps to Launch

## ✅ Current Status: 75% Attribution Accuracy
*As of January 22, 2025 - 11:00 AM*

## 🔧 Quick Fixes Needed (5 minutes in Supabase):

### 1. Run Database Schema Updates
Execute `scripts/fix-all-tables.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to add:
- Conversions table columns (attributed_link_id, device_fingerprint, metadata)
- Clicks table columns (referer, device_fingerprint, session_id)

This will boost attribution accuracy from 75% → 80%+

## 📈 To Reach 80%+ Attribution Accuracy:

### Required Actions:
1. ✅ Universal Pixel: ACTIVE (30 points)
2. ⚠️ Email Capture: Need forms on landing pages (25 points missing)
3. ✅ Device Fingerprinting: WORKING (20 points)
4. ✅ UTM Tracking: ACTIVE (15 points)
5. ✅ Click Tracking: WORKING (10 points)

**Current Score: 75/100 points**
**Need: 5 more points for 80% accuracy**

### Solution:
Add a simple email capture form to the landing page to gain the missing 25 points.

## ✅ What's Working:

1. **Tracking Links**: Creating and redirecting with UTM parameters
2. **Universal Pixel**: Tracking events and identities
3. **Whop Webhooks**: Processing payments and subscriptions
4. **UI/UX**: Mobile responsive, dark mode, all components fixed
5. **Authentication**: Working with proper user sessions

## 🚀 Ready for Beta Launch After:

1. [ ] Run fix-all-tables.sql in Supabase (5 min)
2. [ ] Add email capture to landing page (30 min)
3. [ ] Deploy latest changes to production (automatic via Vercel)
