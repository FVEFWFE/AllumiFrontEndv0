# Allumi Application - Actual Test Report
Date: September 22, 2025

## ⚠️ Critical Finding

**Chrome MCP was not properly loading page content**, but the server logs confirm all pages ARE working and returning 200 status codes.

## 📊 Server Log Analysis

### ✅ Successfully Loading Pages (200 Status)
Based on actual server responses from localhost:3003:

1. **GET /welcome** - 200 ✅
2. **GET /sign-in** - 200 ✅
3. **GET /** - 200 ✅
4. **GET /dashboard** - 200 ✅
5. **GET /dashboard/links** - 200 ✅
6. **GET /dashboard/links/create** - 200 ✅
7. **GET /dashboard/analytics** - 200 ✅
8. **GET /dashboard/billing** - 200 ✅
9. **GET /dashboard/bio** - 200 ✅
10. **GET /dashboard/import** - 200 ✅
11. **POST /api/links/create** - 200 ✅ (API working!)

### ❌ Pages Returning 404
1. **GET /billing** - 404 (but /dashboard/billing works)
2. **GET /dashboard/attribution** - 404 (route not implemented)
3. **GET /favicon.ico** - 404 (missing favicon)

### ⚠️ Pages Not Tested (Timeouts in Chrome)
- /dashboard/affiliates
- /dashboard/settings

## 🔧 Actual Issues Found

### 1. Webhook Error
```
Whop webhook error: RangeError: Input buffers must have the same byte length
at verifyWhopSignature (route.ts:18:9)
```
**Fix**: Already addressed in previous session - need to check signature length before comparison

### 2. BaseHub Module Warning
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'child_process' in basehub/dist
```
**Impact**: Warnings only, not breaking functionality

### 3. Sentry Configuration
- Missing instrumentation file
- Deprecated client config location
**Impact**: Error tracking not working properly

### 4. Missing Routes
- `/dashboard/attribution` - Returns 404
- `/billing` - Returns 404 (should redirect to /dashboard/billing)

## ✅ What's Actually Working

Based on server logs:
- ✅ All main dashboard pages loading
- ✅ Link creation API endpoint working
- ✅ Welcome page loading
- ✅ Sign-in page loading
- ✅ Analytics, billing, bio, import pages all returning 200

## 🚀 Real Priorities

### High Priority
1. Fix webhook signature verification error
2. Implement `/dashboard/attribution` route
3. Redirect `/billing` to `/dashboard/billing`

### Medium Priority
1. Add favicon.ico file
2. Fix Sentry instrumentation setup
3. Test `/dashboard/affiliates` and `/dashboard/settings` properly

### Low Priority
1. Fix BaseHub child_process warnings
2. Clean up webpack cache issues

## 📝 Testing Methodology Issue

**Chrome MCP Tool Limitations**: The tool was showing empty content or timeouts even though the server was successfully serving pages. For accurate testing:
1. Need to test directly in browser
2. Or use different automation tool
3. Check server logs for actual status codes

## Summary

The application is MORE functional than initially reported. Most pages are loading successfully (200 status). The main issues are:
1. Missing attribution route
2. Webhook signature verification error
3. Some routing inconsistencies (/billing vs /dashboard/billing)

The core application appears to be working well based on server responses.
