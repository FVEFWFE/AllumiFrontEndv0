## 🔴 WHAT'S ACTUALLY MISSING

### 1. **Test Data Generator** - CRITICAL
Without test data, the system looks broken even though it works!

**Build this TODAY**:
```javascript
// scripts/generate-test-data.js
- Create 100 fake conversions
- Generate campaign metrics
- Populate analytics dashboard
- Create sample bio pages
- Generate affiliate data
```

### 2. **End-to-End Test Suite**
**Automated testing to verify everything works**:
```javascript
// scripts/test-attribution-flow.js
- Create tracking link
- Simulate clicks from multiple sources
- Trigger conversions
- Verify attribution accuracy
- Check dashboard updates
```

### 3. **Zapier Webhook Endpoint**
**May already exist but needs testing**:
- Check if `/api/webhooks/zapier` exists
- Test with Zapier webhook tester
- Document setup process

### 4. **User Documentation**
**They have the tools but don't know how to use them**:
- Getting Started guide
- Video walkthrough
- FAQ section
- API documentation
