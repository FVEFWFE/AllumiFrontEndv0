## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### If you can't find "Checkout links":

- It might be under the product's main page
- Look for a "+" or "Add" button

### If trial option isn't visible:
- Make sure you selected "Recurring" type first
- Look in "Advanced settings" or "More options"
- It might be called "Free trial period" or "Trial days"

### If webhook isn't working:
- Double-check the URL has no typos
- Make sure it's HTTPS not HTTP
- Try removing and re-adding the webhook

## ðŸ“± Quick Alternative: Direct Links

If you have trouble creating the checkout link, you can try these direct URLs:

1. **Product checkout** (may not have trial):
   ```
   https://whop.com/checkout/prod_tm0tLYKsvpwxi/
   ```

2. **Marketplace page**:
   ```
   https://whop.com/allumi/
   ```

But creating a proper checkout link with trial is preferred!
