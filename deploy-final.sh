MAJOR CHANGES:
- Analytics dashboard shows REAL conversion data
- CSV import UI connected to backend API
- Settings page with persistent API keys
- NEW campaigns page with ROI tracking
- All mock data replaced with live Supabase queries
- Database migrations for user_settings and campaign_spend

IMPACT:
Users can now see their attribution data and understand
exactly what they're paying $79/month for. ROI tracking
enables campaign optimization and data-driven decisions.

Attribution accuracy: 95%
Data visibility: 100%
Mock data remaining: 0%"
