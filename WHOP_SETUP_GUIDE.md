# ðŸ”§ Whop Configuration Guide for Allumi

## ðŸ“‹ Required Setup in Whop Dashboard

### 1. **Configure Success/Cancel URLs**

In your Whop product settings, set these URLs:

```
Success URL: https://allumi.com/welcome?source=whop
Cancel URL: https://allumi.com/pricing?cancelled=true
```

### 2. **Configure Webhooks**

Add these webhook endpoints in Whop dashboard:

```
Trial Started: https://allumi.com/api/webhooks/whop/trial-started
Payment Succeeded: https://allumi.com/api/webhooks/whop/payment
Subscription Updated: https://allumi.com/api/webhooks/whop/subscription
```

### 3. **Environment Variables Needed**

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Whop Configuration
WHOP_CHECKOUT_LINK=link_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  # Your checkout link ID
WHOP_PRODUCT_ID=prod_XXXXXXXXXXXXX      # Your product ID
WHOP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_XXXXXXXXXXXX  # Webhook signing secret
WHOP_API_KEY=wapi_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX # API key for Whop API calls
```

## ðŸ”„ User Flow After Payment

### What Happens:

1. **User completes payment on Whop**
   - Card is authorized
   - 14-day trial starts
   - Whop sends webhook to our endpoint

2. **Webhook creates user profile**
   - `/api/webhooks/whop/trial-started` receives data
   - User profile created in Supabase
   - Trial end date set (14 days)

3. **User redirected to `/welcome`**
   - Confetti celebration
   - Demo dashboard shown
   - Persona selection
   - Account creation
   - First link generated

4. **User lands in dashboard**
   - Trial banner shows days remaining
   - Onboarding checklist visible
   - Ready to track conversions

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Flow

### Local Testing:
```bash
# 1. Use ngrok to expose local endpoint
ngrok http 3000

# 2. Set webhook URL in Whop to:
https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/whop/trial-started

# 3. Create test purchase in Whop test mode
```

### Verify Success:
- [ ] Webhook received and logged
- [ ] User created in database
- [ ] Redirect to `/welcome` works
- [ ] Trial banner shows correct end date
- [ ] Demo dashboard loads

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Success Points

### Must Work:
1. **Redirect URL** - User must land on `/welcome` after payment
2. **Account Creation** - Seamless signup with email from Whop
3. **Trial Tracking** - Show "Day X of 14" everywhere
4. **Value Demo** - Show dashboard with demo data immediately

### Nice to Have:
1. Pre-fill email from Whop webhook
2. Auto-login after account creation
3. Welcome email with next steps
4. Slack notification of new trial
