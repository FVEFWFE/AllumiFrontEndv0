# Push to GitHub Instructions

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name it: AllumiFrontEndv0
3. Make it private or public as you prefer
4. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have files)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Copy these commands
After creating the repo, GitHub will show you the repository URL. 
Replace YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL below with your actual repository URL:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Example (replace with your actual URL):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/AllumiFrontEndv0.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Alternative: Using GitHub CLI
If you have GitHub CLI installed:
```bash
gh repo create AllumiFrontEndv0 --private --source=. --push
```
