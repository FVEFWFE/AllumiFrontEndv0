## üîß Issues & Fixes Needed

### High Priority
1. **Welcome Flow Route**: `/welcome` shows landing page instead of onboarding
2. **Attribution Page**: Returns 404, needs route implementation
3. **Affiliate Program Page**: Times out, needs debugging
4. **Settings Page**: Times out, needs debugging

### Medium Priority
1. **Billing Route Confusion**: `/billing` and `/dashboard/billing` show different content
2. **Trial Mechanics**: Need to verify trial countdown banner and urgency modals are working
3. **Webhook Integration**: Verify Whop webhook auto-authentication is functional

### Low Priority
1. **Empty State Data**: Most dashboards show empty/zero data (expected for new accounts)
2. **Navigation Consistency**: Some routes use `/dashboard/` prefix, others don't

## üìù Features Not Yet Built

Based on the navigation menu and testing:
1. **Attribution Tracking Page** - Route exists in menu but returns 404
2. **Affiliate Program Details** - Page exists but content not loading
3. **Settings & API Configuration** - Page exists but content not loading
4. **Bio Page Builder** - Interface exists but creation functionality not tested
5. **CSV Import Processing** - UI exists but actual import not tested
6. **Zapier Integration** - Mentioned but configuration not accessible

## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix `/welcome` route to show WelcomeContent component
2. Implement `/dashboard/attribution` route
3. Debug timeout issues on affiliates and settings pages
4. Standardize routing (all dashboard pages under `/dashboard/`)

### Next Sprint
1. Complete bio page builder functionality
2. Implement CSV member import processing
3. Add Zapier webhook configuration UI
4. Build out affiliate program features
5. Complete settings page with API key management

### Testing Improvements
1. Add loading states for slow-loading pages
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add user feedback for successful actions (toasts/notifications)
4. Include breadcrumb navigation for better UX

## ‚úÖ Summary

The core functionality (dashboard, link creation, analytics) is working well. The main issues are with incomplete routes and some timeout problems. The application successfully implements:
- Link creation workflow
- Basic dashboard with metrics
- Analytics framework
- Import members UI
- Bio page framework

Priority should be on fixing the broken routes and completing the features that have UI but lack full functionality.
