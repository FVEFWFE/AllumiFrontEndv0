# Allumi Testing Results - January 20, 2025
*Testing conducted from 9:45 AM onwards*

## Executive Summary
Successfully completed Phase 1 and partial Phase 2 testing. Core payment flow and demo capture functionality are working correctly.

## Phase 1: Whop Payment Configuration âœ…

### Key Findings
- **Checkout Link ID Found**: `plan_ufRzE7PHJgEXR`
- **Product Configured**: $59/month with 14-day trial already set up
- **Payment Flow**: Successfully redirects to Whop checkout
- **Checkout URL**: `https://whop.com/checkout/plan_ufRzE7PHJgEXR/?d2c=true`

### Outstanding Items
- Need to obtain Webhook Secret from Whop Developer section
- Need to obtain API credentials (API Key, Client ID, Client Secret)
- Need to test webhook integration with live payments

## Phase 2: User Flow Testing (Partial) ðŸŸ¨

### First-Time Visitor Flow âœ…
- **Demo Modal**: Opens correctly with all 3 fields
- **Form Validation**: Works properly
- **Success Message**: Displays correctly after submission
- **Data Capture**: Successfully captures name, email, and Skool URL

### Known Issues
1. **Attio Integration Error**:
   - Error: "Cannot find attribute with slug/ID 'allumipipeline'"
   - Impact: Pipeline status not updating, but contact still created
   - Resolution needed: Check Attio field configuration

2. **Minor UI Warnings**:
   - Webpack cache warnings (non-critical)
   - Basehub module warnings (child_process not resolved)

## Technical Details

### Environment Configuration
```env
WHOP_PLAN_ID=plan_ufRzE7PHJgEXR
WHOP_CHECKOUT_LINK=plan_ufRzE7PHJgEXR
WHOP_CHECKOUT_BASE_URL=https://whop.com/checkout/
```

### API Interactions Observed
1. **Demo Capture Flow**:
   - Searches for existing Skool profile (5 different search strategies)
   - Falls back to email search
   - Creates new person record if not found
   - Attempts to set pipeline status (currently failing)

### Server Performance
- Dev server running on port 3002 (ports 3000 and 3001 in use)
- Page load times acceptable (~1.2s for homepage)
- API response times reasonable (~594ms for start-trial redirect)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Fix Attio "allumipipeline" field issue
2. Obtain remaining Whop credentials:
   - Webhook Secret
   - API Key
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
3. Test webhook integration with test payments

### Remaining Test Phases
- [ ] Complete Phase 2: Trial signup and dashboard functionality
- [ ] Phase 3: Attribution testing (link creation, identity resolution, conversion tracking)
- [ ] Phase 4: Integration testing (Whop webhooks, database verification)
- [ ] Phase 5: Edge cases and error handling
- [ ] Phase 6: Production readiness checks

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Core payment and demo capture flows working
- **Medium Risk**: Attio pipeline field needs fixing before production
- **High Risk**: Webhook integration not yet tested

## Recommendations
1. Fix Attio field configuration immediately
2. Complete Whop webhook setup today
3. Run full end-to-end test with test payment
4. Consider adding error handling for Attio failures
5. Add monitoring for webhook events
